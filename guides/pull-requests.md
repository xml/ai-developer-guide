# Pull Requests

## Description Guidelines

Pull request descriptions should be extremely terse and focused on essential points only. Use bullet points to highlight the most critical changes, avoiding detailed explanations or implementation specifics. Keep descriptions under 10 bullets maximum, with each bullet being a single, concise statement. Focus on what changed and why, not how it was implemented.

Example of good PR description:
- Fix authentication timeout in user login
- Add retry logic for API calls  
- Update dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities

Avoid descriptions that are overly verbose with excessive bullets, headings, and emojis.
